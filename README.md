# HomeAssistant-PhilipsAndroid2014
Custom component for Philips TV's running Android which are built between 2014 and 2016. Written in Python3 for Home Assistant.
NOTE: Credits fully go to SirGilbot which made this modification based on the original Philips HASS component. I've contacted him and am awaiting his reply.
I will probably be adding features in the future.

I'll be trying to get this module available through HACS for easy installation.

Tested on:
* Philips 55PUS9109/12 (2014)
* Home-Assistant 
    - 0.95.x

 **If you are experiencing issues please be sure to provide details about your device, Home Assistant version and what exactly went wrong.**

## HACS
This component will be submitted to be added to HACS asap.

## Custom Component Installation
!!! PLEASE NOTE !!!: Don't use this method if you are using HACS.
1. Copy the custom_components folder to your own hassio /config folder.

2. In the root of your /config folder, create a file called mediaplayers.yaml

   ```yaml
    - platform: philips_2014
      name: My Philips TV
      host: <ip of your TV>
      mac: <mac address of your TV>
   ```

3. In your configuration.yaml add the following:
  
   ```yaml
   media_player: !include mediaplayers.yaml
   ```

4. OPTIONAL: Add info logging to this component (to see if/how it works)
  
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: error
     logs:
       custom_components.philips_2014: debug
       custom_components.philips_2014.media_player: debug
   ```

5. Restart Home Assistant and enjoy!
